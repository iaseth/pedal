# Pedal

`Pedal` is a command-line utility built on top of the [Awesome Pedalboard Library](https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard).
I use it to apply Pedalboard Effects on Audio without having to write a new `Python` script every time.

I am using [`readmix`](https://github.com/iaseth/readmix) for generating this README.
You can view the source file [here](https://github.com/iaseth/pedal/blob/master/README.md.rx).
